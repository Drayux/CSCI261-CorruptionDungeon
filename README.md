### CORRUPTION DUNGEON: Can you save the land before corruption consumes it?

## ABOUT

< TODO >  
This is one of my older projects, and I look back on it with nostalgia, laughing at all of the mistakes that I'd made along the way. The current state of this code is a working 'proof of concept' as per required in the project submission. As such, it lacks a large number of the features and "polish" that I originally sought to implement.  
Corruption dungeon aims to throw a wrench at the standard dungeon crawler mentality. So often it can become an obsession to explore "every nook and cranny" of the dungeon presented before you. My goal with this project was to throw that out the window. The world our adventurer traverses not only procedurally generates before him, but also, 'procedurally un-generates.' The idea behind this is to force the adventurer to make decisions that they can't change their mind about later.  

## LORE
< TODO >  
Long ago, the land of *cool mystical name* fell under the curse of a great and nefarious wizard *cool wizard name* who sought to lead the "war to end all wars." Upon capture, his five disciples traveled long and far to protect his work, each carrying one of the five "earth stones." These stones remained dormant for thousands of years, until *you* the adventurer, finally unveiled the location of one of the five protective dungeons. These dungeons were not designed to keep people out, but instead, trap them within, so that the location of the earth stones could remain lost for as long as time.  

The entrance to the earth stone of illusion has been found, and you, young adventurer, live in the closest known village.
< Something about *why* we need to collect the stones...perhaps because the war is still raging and they are necessary to end it? >  

If you choose to enter this dungeon, know that none who have entered before have ever returned. *This includes the disciple that built it.* Under the power of the earth stone, the path will lay itself before you, but, as your power grows, the path behind you will begin to crumble. Can you retrieve the stone before the power infects your mind, and you find yourself trapped in the void, withering to dust from insanity?  

## FUTURE

As mentioned, I built this project early on in my programming career, so I lacked many of the skills that I have today, that I would have needed to build it to my dream. In light of rebuilding the game from scratch, revising the graphics (switching from 2D to 3D), and adding many of the features I failed to under the original deadline of this project, this project will remain as is, and will ultimately be replaced by Corruption Dungeon v2.  

I began this project the summer after the semester I built the original version of the game. In this, I explored the OpenGL pipeline, and taught myself many of the things necessary to build the game in a virtual 3D world, thus inspiring my love for the math behind 3D graphics, and subsequently virtual reality, as the next step beyond. The latter project came to a halt when I became *more* fascinated with building a game engine, as opposed to just building the project in of itself. My later project, STL view, is a Python implementation of all of the things I learned while working on Corruption Dungeon v2 a few years prior.  

Ultimately, I dream of this game not only procedurally generating unique and diverse dungeons, but also featuring uncanny degrees of corruption, and procedurally generated puzzles that do not feel repetitive. Further, I want combat to remain interesting, perhaps offering elements of RTS games, or some form of magic mechanic that can be paused at anytime, keeping the game low-stress yet incredibly compelling.

## COURSE AFFILIATION

< TODO >  
This project was built as my final project for CSCI261: Programming Concepts. The goal of this project was to be very open-ended, so the specifics of the game are all of my own design.

## LINKEDIN DESCRIPTION

An inquisitive exploration of procedural generation through a top-down dungeon game. This project was my first attempt at building a simple video game, and was built to its current state within a short time, as my "open-ended" final project for CSCI261 (Programming Concepts.) Further, this project was a great opportunity for me to explore a more creative side of programming, which involves constructing an interesting experience for an end user.  
  
At the time of writing this project, my skill as a programmer sat well behind my ambitions, and I was quickly inspired to expand upon this project with numerous other features. Most notably, I wanted to recreate the project in 3D. Doing so, led me to traverse the rabbit hole of 3D graphics and I quickly found a deep appreciation for the mathematics that makes it possible.  
  
Ultimately, my dream for this game would not only generates unique and diverse dungeons to explore, but also feature uncanny degrees of world corruption. Additionally, I would like to experiment with using procedural generation for puzzles within the game, possibly as a means of keeping combat dynamic and interesting to the player, perhaps offering elements of real-time strategy games, or some form of magic mechanic that can be paused at anytime.
